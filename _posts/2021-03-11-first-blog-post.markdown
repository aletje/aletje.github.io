### Welcome
On this blog I will be documenting new or challenging concepts in Data Engineering that I learn throughtout my Nano Degree in Data Engineering at Udacity. I will share and discuss important concepts that I learn throughout my course, and also share valuable lessons I'm encountering on my path to begin freelancing as a Data Engineer helping people and companies to transform their data into valuable inights.
