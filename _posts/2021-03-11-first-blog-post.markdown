### Dear reader, a warm welcome to you. 
On this blog I'm documenting new or challenging concepts in Data Engineering that I learn throughtout my Nano Degree in Data Engineering at Udacity. I will share and discuss important concepts that I learn throughout my course, and also share valuable lessons I'm encountering on my path to begin freelancing as a Data Engineer helping companies to transform their data into valuable inights.
